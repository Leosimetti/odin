# Analysis should be able to detect mutual recursion
# no matter where the base and derived classes are.

# [abstractions.]base.f calls g
# [implementations.]derived extends abstractions.base
# derived.g overrides base g to call derived.f (which is inherited from base)
# So, we have a loop:
# derived.g -> derived.f. -> derived.g
